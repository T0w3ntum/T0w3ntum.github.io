<h3 id="saturday-august-6th-10-am">Saturday, August 6th: 10 AM</h3>

<p>I eagerly opened up the email and read through the information. Both laptops were prepped and ready to go and I had a 10 pack of Monster Energy sitting in the fridge (9 if you count
the one I had already downed.) I had a game plan, I was ready for this…I was so wrong!</p>

<h3 id="1045-am">10:45 AM</h3>

<p>BAM! First box down. Confidence level: 1000%</p>

<p>I had prepped for this, I was ready. This box was my bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>Feeling like a God, I rush off and check my initial scans on the remaining boxes. Like any good pentester, I start to further enumerate my findings through various methods. Many
interesting things stand out…many gotchas as well.</p>

<h3 id="200-pm">2:00 PM</h3>

<p>Confidence Level: 90%</p>

<p>After 3 hours I was no closer to a low priv shell on the remaining boxes. I did have a lot of information to go off of though. I found that I was bouncing around to much, jumping
from host to host after only 30 minutes. At this point I decided it was a good time for a break and left the house to run my wife some food at work.</p>

<h3 id="830-pm">8:30 PM</h3>

<p>Confidence Level: 5%</p>

<p>It was at this point, approaching the half way mark, that I started to curse the world. I was doubting my abilities; wondering why I even signed up for this course in the first
place. I spent so much time practicing one skill that the rest of them just weren’t there. I had made 0 progress in nearly 10 hours! Sure, I found some things, I could get MORE
information, but I no clue what information I should be getting…</p>

<p>I went to my room feeling defeated and decided on 20 minutes of shut eye. I thought maybe if I rested my brain for a minute things would start to click…I was wrong. Ten minutes
later I was back at it.</p>

<h3 id="1230-am">12:30 AM</h3>

<p>Confide…There was no confidence at this point!</p>

<p>At this point I threw my hands up and decided a longer bit of sleep was needed. I set my alarm for 3 AM and laid down…</p>

<h3 id="500-am">5:00 AM</h3>

<p>ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!</p>

<p>My wife’s alarm buzzed as I jumped out of bed realizing I didn’t turn my freaking volume up on my phone. Now I only had 5 hours left and only 1 host…ONE HOST! I needed at least 3
more to pass this exam. Screw confidence at this point, every stat was at 0…0 confidence, 0 intelligence, 0 self worth. I’m screwed!</p>

<h3 id="637-am">6:37 AM</h3>

<p>Text to my wife:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I’m sure I failed!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="800-am">8:00 AM</h3>

<p>Chair flies behind me as I land root on another machine! Confidence restored, I only need TWO MORE HOSTS!</p>

<h3 id="830-am">8:30 AM</h3>

<p>Confidence level: 90%
Another host bites it!
OMG!!! One more host to go, just ONE MORE HOST and I got this, I win this game! I’m 10 points from the finish line. I have one hour and 15 minutes to land one more host.</p>

<h3 id="845-am">8:45 AM</h3>

<p>We got this…WE GOT THIS. Just picked up a low priv shell on one more host. Just need to escalate and I’m home free. Sitting at 60 points, if I get this host I’ll have enough
points to pass. LET’S ESCALATE!</p>

<h3 id="945-am">9:45 AM</h3>

<p>Tap0 disconnects, exam time is over. Total score: 60 points with one low priv shell. 65 points if you count my Lab report as well. Will they count that low priv? Will I get points
for it?</p>

<p>Confidence level: 50%</p>

<p>Yes…50%. It’s in the hands of offsec right now.</p>

<h3 id="noon">Noon</h3>

<p>Lab report and exam report sent off to Offsec.</p>

<h2 id="monday-635-pm">Monday 6:35 PM</h2>

<h1 id="victory">VICTORY!</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are happy to inform you that you have successfully completed the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux certification exam and have obtained your Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification.</p>

<h1 id="official-review">Official Review!</h1>

<p>Don’t go into the exam lightly, and don’t rush! I landed all hosts in the lab environment in <strong>41</strong> days and felt very confident that I would smash the exam. I even set an arbitrary limit on myself, told myself I’d get it in under 12 hours and have the weekend to myself. Oh how wrong I was.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say it was a lack of skill, the skill was there. The mental game was where it was at. I had 24 hours…<strong>24 hours</strong> to own the required number of hosts and I rushed. I bounced around without focus thinking I would just know what to do.</p>

<p>After I rested and went back to it with no confidence thinking I would fail; That’s when things started to click. When I had reached the point of failure thinking I wouldn’t pass things started to fall into place. It’s amazing what the right mindset will do for you! It was almost like I had to approach it as if I wasn’t going to win, like I was playing an impossible game and instead of focusing on winning, I should just focus on surviving until the very end.</p>

<p>In the end, I have no technical review, I have no advice on what you should and should not study. Instead, I’ll leave you with this quote:</p>
